## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of statistical modelling with R.
- Participants should bring their own laptops with **R and RStudio installed**.
- Some **package dependencies** are heavy, so it is recommended to install them
  beforehand as follows:
  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  install.packages(c("sf", "stars", "terra", "s2", "gstat", "spatstat", "spdep", "spatialreg", "mgcv"))
  install.packages("starsdata", repos = "https://cran.uni-muenster.de/pebesma", type = "source")
  install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://nowosad.github.io/drat/", type = "source")
  ```
- **R-INLA** is required too. For OS-specific installation instructions,
  see [this link](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install)
- If time permits, the instructor suggests reading the following chapters from
  [Spatial Data Science](https://r-spatial.org/book/):<br>3-7, 10-12, 14-16
